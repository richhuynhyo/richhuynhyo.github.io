						<h4>Overview:</h4>
						<p>
							MSI Marketing approached me to make the MSI Deals Page: A webpage that would list and direct users to discounted MSI product deals at different online retailers.
                            In the past, MSI launched similar web pages that displayed deals for short-lived seasonal campaigns. However, the new initiative would take a more evergreen approach. 
							The MSI Deals Page would remain "always-on" and be updated more frequently with various campaigns and deals throughout the year.

						<h4>Challenges:</h4>
						<p>
							The MSI Deals Page would iterate on similar seasonal campaign pages in the past. However, these past implementations had challenges in updating and maintaining these pages.
                            Updating the deals took a long time. They had to be manually coded in HTML by a web developer.
                            Deal pricing would often be inaccurate and inconsistent due to quick price changes by the sellers. This lengthy process of updating deals compounded this issue.                            
                            For the MSI Deals Page to be feasible, these issues had to be addressed among additional design changes to accommodate an updatable "always-on" webpage.
						</p>
						<p>
							The web page was limited to being hosted on a CMS with no access to a database or back-end development. Solutions had to be developed almost entirely with front-end technology.							
						</p>

						<h4>Objectives:</h4>
						<p>
							After evaluating the project goals and challenges, I established two primary objectives:
						</p>
						<ul class="special">
							<li>
								<span class="highlight"><b>Design and develop the customizable, customer-facing MSI Deals Page.</b></span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="highlight"><b>Improve the production process for updating the page's content.</b></span>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							With a limited timeline and an expectation to deliver the web page for an upcoming campaign, I took a rapid iteration approach to the project.
						</p>
					</section>

					<div class="h-line" aria-hidden="true"></div>									
							
					<!-- Add deal tag function with querystring			

					look for methods of improving content production efficiency

					rapidly product working version due to short timeline

					generic deals -> summer deals -> Back to school -->
					<section id="chapter-userflow" class="case-text">	
						<h4>1st Iteration (Week 1):</h4>
						<h5>
							Consumer-Facing Site - Initial Redesign
						</h5>
						<p>											
							With a sales campaign launch approaching, my priority was to design and develop the consumer-facing MSI Deals Page. 
							Using previous campaigns as a model, I neutralized the color and themes to give the page flexibility to work with varying art directions for different campaigns. I also implemented a "tagging" system for improved product discoverability.
						</p>
						<h5>
							Workflow Improvement - Early Stages
						</h5>
						<p>
							Because page design was the priority, initial methods of improving workflow were rudimentary and only marginally improved production efficiency. The initial effort laid the groundwork for more substantial improvements in later iterations.
						</p>						
						<ul>							
							<li>
								<b>Created an semi-automated Excel template deliverable.</b>
								<p>
									In past campaigns, the marketing team sent Google Sheets containing deal information to the design team. To save time on the design team's manual page updates, I concatenated cell data into HTML blocks that could be easily copied and pasted into the page code.								
								</p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Created a library of reusable partner retailer logos.</b>
								<p>I trimmed the logos to a uniform size. I also concatenated the image URLS into the Excel deliverable. </p>

							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Initiated the creation of product image library.</b>
								<p>
									The method would improve production in the future, but still required designers to manually create product images. 
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>

						<h4>2nd Iteration (Week 2):</h4>
						<h5>
							Hatch - Where To Buy Solution
						</h5>
						<p>							
							After successfully launching the first iteration of the Deals Page, MSI HQ Marketing Team authorized me to implement Hatch, a third-party Where To Buy solution.
							Hatch provided an embeddable plugin that would automatically update a product's pricing. 
							I was also given access to MSI HQ's Hatch API which would offer greater customizeability. 
							Due to the limited time before the next deal update, I opted to use the Hatch embed function and prioritize improving the deal update workflow.																	
						</p>
						

						<h5>
							Workflow Automation - Templating from Data
						</h5>
						<p>							
							For this iteration, I prioritized automating the repetitive, time-demanding task of manually writing HTML code. Consequently, I gave marketers more precise control over deal content and the ability to self-QA before sending deliverables to designers to upload into the CMS.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h6>
							Generating HTML Content from AJAX
						</h6>
						<p>
							By repurposing some of functions for concatenating Excel data from before, I wrote a
							template script that generated HTML using JSON data to fill preset variables. 
							I opted for a JSON/AJAX solution because I did not have access to the CMS database.
						</p>
						<br />
						<h6>
							Generating Data Files from User Input
						</h6>
						<p>
							After developing the templating script, I devised a method for converting user input into JSON files.							 
						</p>
						<ul>							
							<li>
								<b>Use Google Sheets for Familiarity</b>
								<p>
									Having considered creating an entirely new tool to write JSON data directly from user input, I instead chose to maintain the use of Google Sheets for receiving user input. 
									I created a standardized Google Sheet with predefined columns that corresponded with JSON variables in the template script. 
									This reduced development time as well as the amount of training I need to provide to marketers on the updated workflow.
								</p>								
							</li>							
							<li>
								<b>Use Pre-existing Assets</b>
								<p>
									The Hatch where-to-buy module already contained a retailer logo library, which removed the need to maintain the previously created library. 
									Looking for a similar solution for product images, I decided to give marketers control of the product images by selecting the image from the product's page gallery. 
									Marketers simply needed to input the image URL from the page gallery into the a predefined column in the Google Sheet template.
								</p>
							</li>						
							<li>
								<b>Custom Tool to Convert CSV into JSON</b>
								<p>
									After establishing user input would be handled by Google Sheets, I need to convert that data into JSON text files.
                                    I designed and developed a custom solution that would allow marketers to convert uploaded Google Sheet CSV files into downloadable JSON files with a single click.
                                    The tool generated an interactive preview for marketers to QA their content before sending the JSON file to the design team.
								</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
						<h5>
							Design Audit
						</h5>
						<p>
							Templating from Data and Hatch provided many opportunities for the Deal Page design, but there were some issues with the new implementation. 
						</p>
						<br />
						<h6>
							Pros:
						</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>More Deals</b>
								<p>The improved workflow allowed for displaying and updating more deals. The page design no longer needed to accommodate the difficulty of deal updates.
									I added an extra column of deals and removed the bottom carousel to simplify the page design.
								</p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Specific Deal Messaging</b>
								<p>With prices moved to the Hatch popup menu, the initial deal module could now display marketer-controlled messaging.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>
							Cons:
						</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Hatch Service Issues</b>
								<p>Limited Internet connectivity or ad-block could cause the Hatch buttons to not load.</p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Custom-Link Unpredictability</b>
								<p>
									As a result of Hatch not listing some specific promotions, I created a "custom-link" workaround to give marketers the ability to link the "Shop Now" button directly to retailers.
                                    However, this created an unpredictable experience when some of the "Shop Now" buttons linked directly while others displayed the Hatch popup menu.
								</p>
							</li>
