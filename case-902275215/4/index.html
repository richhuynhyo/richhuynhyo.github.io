						<h4>Overview:</h4>
						<p>
							MSI Marketing approached me to make the MSI Deals Page: A webpage that would list and direct users to discounted MSI product deals at different online retailers.
                            In the past, MSI launched similar web pages that displayed deals for short-lived seasonal campaigns. However, the new initiative would take a more evergreen approach. 
							The MSI Deals Page would remain "always-on" and be updated more frequently with various campaigns and deals throughout the year. 
						</p>

							Project Lead<br />
							UI/UX Designer<br />
							Front-End Engineer

						<h4>Challenges:</h4>
						<p>
							The MSI Deals Page would iterate on similar seasonal campaign pages in the past. However, these past implementations had challenges in updating and maintaining these pages.
                            Updating the deals took a long time. They had to be manually coded in HTML by a web developer.
                            Deal pricing would often be inaccurate and inconsistent due to quick price changes by the sellers. This lengthy process of updating deals compounded this issue.                            
                            For the MSI Deals Page to be feasible, these issues had to be addressed among additional design changes to accommodate an updatable "always-on" webpage.
						</p>
						<p>
							The web page was limited to being hosted on a CMS with no access to a database or back-end development. Solutions had to be developed almost entirely with front-end technology.							
						</p>

						<h4>Objectives:</h4>
						<p>
							After evaluating the project goals and challenges, I established two primary objectives:
						</p>
						<ul class="special">
							<li>
								<span class="highlight"><b>Design and develop the customizable, customer-facing MSI Deals Page.</b></span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="highlight"><b>Improve the production process for updating the page's content.</b></span>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							With a limited timeline and an expectation to deliver the web page for an upcoming campaign, I took a rapid iteration approach to the project.
						</p>
					</section>

					<div class="h-line" aria-hidden="true"></div>									
							
					<!-- Add deal tag function with querystring			

					look for methods of improving content production efficiency

					rapidly product working version due to short timeline

					generic deals -> summer deals -> Back to school -->
					<section id="chapter-userflow" class="case-text">	
						<h4>(Week 1) - 1st iteration:</h4>
						<h5>
							Consumer-Facing Site - Initial Redesign
						</h5>
						<p>											
							With a sales campaign launch approaching, my priority was to design and develop the consumer-facing MSI Deals Page. Using previous campaigns as a model, I neutralized the color and themes to give the page flexibility to work with varying art directions for different campaigns. I also implemented a "tagging" system for improved product discoverability.
						</p>
						<h5>
							Workflow Improvement - Early Stages
						</h5>
						<p>
							Because page design was the priority, initial methods of improving workflow were rudimentary and only marginally improved production efficiency. The initial effort laid the groundwork for more substantial improvements in later iterations.
						</p>						
						<ul>							
							<li>
								<b>Created an semi-automated Excel template deliverable.</b>
								<p>I concatenated cell data into HTML blocks that can be easily copy and pasted into the page code.</p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Created a library of reusable partner retailer logos.</b>
								<p>I trimmed the logos to a uniform size. I also concatenated the image URLS into the Excel deliverable. </p>

							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Initiated the creation of product image library.</b>
								<p>
									The method would improve production in the future, but still required designers to manually create product images for the time being. 
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>

						<h4>(Week 2) - 2nd iteration:</h4>
						<h5>
							Hatch - Where To Buy Solution
						</h5>
						<p>							
							After successfully launching the first iteration of the Deals Page, MSI HQ Marketing Team authorized me to implement Hatch, a third-party Where To Buy solution. Hatch provided an embeddable plugin that would automatically update a product's pricing. Hatch provided a lot of great opportunities but carried some issues.

							issue
								hatch had issues with ad block
								custom link retailer was too unpredictable						
						</p>
						

						<h5>
							Workflow Automation Tool - Templating from Data
						</h5>
						<p>
							workflow update:
							adopted full templating through data ajax to improve content production
								Data design
									use website product pages for images allow marketers more precise control for image									
								templating
								templating engine

							rapidly design/develop tool prototype so individual marketers can provide on deals
								decentralized data input
								design workflow
									1 - use google sheets for familiarity
									2 - simple 3 step tool
									3 - preview for self QA
									4- simple deliverable for update CMS	
								in-person training		
						</p>
						<ul>							
							<li>
								<b>Created an semi-automated Excel template deliverable.</b>
								<p>that concatenated cells into HTML that can be copy/pasted. </p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Created a library of reusable partner retailer logos.</b>
								<p>asdasdasdasd</p>

							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Initiated the creation of product image library.</b>
								<p>
									The method still required designers to manually create product images for the time being. 
								</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
						<h5>
							Design Audit
						</h5>
						<p>
							Templating from Data and Hatch provided many opportunities for the Deal Page design, but there were some issues with the new implementation. 
						</p>
						<br />
						<h6>
							Pros:
						</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>More Deals</b>
								<p>The improved workflow allowed for displaying more deals. The page design no longer needed to accommodate the difficulty of deal updates.</p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Specific Deal Messaging</b>
								<p>With prices moved to the Hatch popup menu, the initial deal module could now display admin-controlled messaging.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>
							Cons:
						</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Hatch Service Issues</b>
								<p>Limited Internet connectivity or ad-block could cause the Hatch buttons to not load.</p>
								 
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Custom-Link Unpredictability</b>
								<p>Some of the [Shop Now] buttons linked directly to retailers while others displayed the Hatch popup menu, creating a disorienting and unpredictable experience.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
