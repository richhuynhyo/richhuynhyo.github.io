						<h4>Overview:</h4>
						<p>							
							iTrustCapital tasked me with a total revamp of their consumer-facing website and its integrated content management platform. Over a 6-month period, I successfully executed a complete overhaul of the website, serving as both the sole designer and developer. The website revamp contributed to a <strong class="highlight">+45% increase in Account Creation Conversion Rate.</strong>

						<h4>Challenges:</h4>
						<p>
							There were challenges with the original website that prompted the need for a revamp. The original website was developed externally, making updates and maintenance both costly and time-consuming. Management also felt that the visual identity was too generic and desired a more captivating design that could better revitalize the company's brand and improve user engagement.
						</p>
					</section>


					<section id="chapter-objectives" class="case-text">	
						<h4>Objectives:</h4>
						<ul class="special">
							<li>
								<span class=""><b>Revitalize the company's visual identity.</b></span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class=""><b>Develop a more compelling user journey to improve the account conversion rate.</b></span>

						<h4>Executive Alignment:</h4>
						<p>
							The first step of the process was to gather requirements from senior management to identify the current challenges and objectives for the redesign. I received suggestions regarding the visual direction and requirements for introducing new or enhanced key elements. This step in the process helped in understanding the company's goals, brand identity, and target audience.

						<h4>Analysis:</h4>
						<h5>
							Competitive Analysis
						</h5>
						<p>											
							I analyzed the homepage storytelling of multiple competitors, noting common themes and identifying industry trends. I also identified strategies to improve iTrustCapital's website and assessed the pros and cons of competitors compared to the old site.
						</p>
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/analysis.jpg" alt="Initial Redesign" />
						</div>
						<br />
						<h5>
							User Research
						</h5>
						<p>
							I was supplied with the video recordings of a usability test conducted prior. This test involved participants of varying genders and incomes across two age groups: 35-45 and 25-35. Each participant navigated both the iTrustCapital website and a competitor's website. Both their screens and face were recorded as they described their likes and dislikes of each website experience. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I analyzed the video recordings, noting the likes and dislikes, and identifying common preferences and pain points among participant and across both age groups. When presenting my findings, I gave higher weight in relevance to answers from participants who fit the target audience model provided by management.
						</p>		
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/user-research.jpg" alt="Video player with notes." />
						</div>
						<br /><br />
						<h6>Findings:</h6>
						<p>My findings identified that both cohorts generally preferred the color scheme and "How It Works" section that was present on the competitor's site but missing from the iTrustCapital site.</p>

						<h4>Storytelling:</h4>
						<h5>
							Modeling the Conversion Journey
						</h5>
						<p>											
							Taking note of competitor strategies and user preferences for a "How It Works" section, I created a new marketing model using the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) framework as inspiration. This model breaks down the process of encouraging action into as show below:
						</p>
						<br />
						<h6>Encourage Action:</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>Grab Attention</li>
							<li>Create Trust</li>
							<li>Appear Approachable</li>
							<li>Price Attractively</li>
							<li>Demonstrate Benefits</li>
							<li>Inspire Confidence</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<p>
							I drafted a new homepage structure by reappropriating and restructuring the content of the iTrustCapital site and competitor sites into a new journey that accommodated all the pillars of this model.
						</p>

						<br /><br />
						<h5>
							Information Architecture
						</h5>
						<p>											
							I created an information architecture to support the updated homepage journey and translated the rest of the old site pages into a more organized and simplified format. 
						</p>
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/info-arch.jpg" alt="Information Architecture of the website." />

					<section id="chapter-vd" class="case-text">	
						<h4>
							Visual Design
						</h4>
						<h5>
							Low Fidelity Mockups
						</h5>
						<p>
							With the information architecture set, I moved on to designing the visual identity. Drawing inspiration from the suggested visual direction discussed during executive alignment, I produced an assortment of low-fidelity desktop homepage mockups for stakeholder review.
						</p>	
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/low-fi.jpg" alt="8 Various Low-Fi Mockups." />
						</div>					
						<br /><br />
						<h5>
							High Fidelity Mockups
						</h5>
						<p>
							Low-fidelity mockups were reviewed by stakeholders, who chose three visual styles to proceed with. I took their feedback and made edits to the three chosen styles, producing high-fidelity, desktop and mobile mockups for another round of review. 
						</p>
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/hi-fi.jpg" alt="3 Various Hi-Fi Mockups." />
						</div>		
						<br /><br />
						<h5>
							Propagation
						</h5>
						<p>
							One of the high-fidelity mockups was approved which established the visual identity moving forward. I propagated the visual identity onto the mockups for the rest of the pages on the website. These mockups went through a more rapid review cycle.
						</p>

					<section id="chapter-ta" class="case-text">	
						<h4>
							Technology Assessment
						</h4>
						<h5>
							Next.js
						</h5>
						<p>
							With the designs approved, it was time to move on to development. Next.js was chosen as the framework for the website since it was already being used for the iTrustCapital platform. Sharing a common tech stack would enable organizational shared-knowledge redundancy, which is important because it ensures that multiple team members are familiar with the technology stack and can easily collaborate, troubleshoot, and maintain the system
						</p>	
						<br /><br />
						<h5>Headless CMS</h5>
						<p>
							I researched multiple Headless CMS's, focusing primarily on affordability, security, flexibility, ease of use, and quality of documentation. After demoing various technologies, I concluded that Directus would be the best solution and presented my findings to management. Directus was approved, allowing for development to begin.

							Demonstration Slides

						<h4>Production-Ready Assets:</h4>
						<p>														
							As development was underway, I needed to create the visual elements to be displayed on the page. The defining elements with the greatest impact would be the backgrounds assets and the 3D hero model.
						</p>
						<br /><br />
						<h5>Backgrounds Assets</h5>
						<p>
							Background assets were created in Photoshop. They were designed to be reusable, customizable, and modular, allowing for dynamic application to pages generated through the headless CMS.
						</p>
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/bg.jpg" alt="Website background elements." />
						</div>
						<br /><br />
						<h5>3D Hero Model</h5>
						<p>
							By request of management, an interactive 3D hero model became a requirement. Initially, I textured and posed pre-made models, but the exported file size exceeded 10 MB even after compression.
						</p>
						<p>
							To reduce the file size, I imported the models into Blender, where I deleted unnecessary mesh objects and merged vertices where possible. I also simplified the laptop body with simple polygons, resulting in over a 98% size-reduction to a final export size of 246 KB.
						</p>

					<section id="chapter-dev" class="case-text">	
						<h4>
							Development:
						</h4>
						<h5>
							Interactive 3D Model Hero
						</h5>
						<p>							
							I implemented the interactive 3D hero model onto the page using Three.js and Drei. The model follows the cursor hover, adding a bit of flair to the initial visitor experience. On mobile, the model is replaced with a static image to reduce site payload size.
						</p>	
						<br /><br />
						<h5>Interactive Market Data</h5>
						<p>							
							I constructed interactive crypto market charts using D3.js for data visualization of live crypto market data fetched from the iTrustCapital backend. In the individual asset view, I added a hoverable chart that displays price data at the specific time hovered.
						</p>	
						<div class="case-img">
							<img src="img/markets.jpg" alt="Interative markets data modules." />
						</div>				
						<br /><br />
						<h5>Learning Material & News Publication</h5>
						<p>							
							I built the iTrustCapital "Learn Center," a news and education resource featuring multiple articles and videos. Using the full range of Directus capabilities, I constructed designed the data structure, editor views, and managed permissions. The result is a full-featured platform with a homepage showcasing updated features and recent content, individual article pages with embedded videos, and a functional search.
						</p>

							Data Design

							Explorable Content Catalog

					<section id="chapter-launch" class="case-text">	
						<h4>
							Launch:
						</h4>
						<h5>QA Environment</h5>
						<p>
							I coordinated with DevOps to set up the build pipeline and launched the website in a test environment. The website underwent internal testing on both desktop and mobile devices to identify any runtime errors, text errors, or graphical issues. Bugs were identified, caught, and fixed in preparation for the production launch.
						</p>	
						<h5>Live & Results</h5>
						<p>							
							The website launched a few weeks ahead of schedule and received high praise from management and the entire company.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over the past year, the new design contributed to a +45% increase in the account creation conversion rate. The implemented headless CMS allowed the team to efficiently add over a hundred articles. The website was continuously iterated on, with many new pages and features being added.
