			+1 STR Fitness is a parody video work-out series for the popular video game-focused website 			
			<![CDATA[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.destructoid.com">Destructoid</a>]]>. 				
			While assisting in the production of this video, I created a simple motion graphic 
			that introduced the website's brand and the title of the show, while maintaining the 
			already established graphic style of the website.

			This illustration was primarily a practice in perspective. 
			Photoshop's transform tool was used liberally to assist in establishing perspective.
			Blending and masking was also used to add texture and shading to the subjects.

			My band <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pachucaband.com">Pachuca</a>		
			needed pins for promotion. I created this design under the direction of <i>Squid Pop</i> -a term 
			that encompasses "fun", "the beach", and "a bit of weirdness."

			This was a assignment in a graphic design course that called for a graphical interpretation of song lyrics.
			I chose the song <i>The Woodpile</i> by Frightened Rabbit, a song that 
			describes a person's social anxiety and desperation. The narrator is portrayed
			with an image of shoes as to be grounded in his own reality, while the 
			rest of the room is portrayed as glowing silhouettes that appear to have
			ascended into a perceived magical existence. The yellow 
			text creates a barrier between the red passion of the room and of the 
			narrator.

			This was a pattern created for a 2d design course. This pattern was a
			practice in contrast between geometric and organic shapes and
			complementary colors. It portrays a seperation between humans from nature
			as well as humans from eachother. The warmer use of colors is used to convey
			a discomforting, claustrophobic sensation.
